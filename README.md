NYC Taxi Trip Analysis and Prediction Project 
===================================================================================

🎯 Project Overview
-------------------------------------------------------------

This project explores a large, real-world dataset of New York City (NYC) taxi trips, applying various machine learning techniques to solve both **regression** and **classification** problems. <-- The double asterisks \*\* make the text **bold**.

\--- <-- Renders as a horizontal line separator

⭐️ Key Objectives
-----------------------------------------------------------

This project is segmented into two main machine learning tasks:

### 1\. Trip Duration Prediction (Regression)

**Goal:** Predict the exact travel time (in seconds) for a taxi journey based on environmental and trip-specific features.

*   **Target Variable:** trip\_duration (Continuous, Numeric) <-- The \* creates a bulleted list item.
    

### 2\. Vendor Classification (Classification)

**Goal:** Classify which of the two major taxi vendors performed the trip, based on the spatial and temporal characteristics of the journey.

*   **Target Variable:** vendor\_id (Discrete, Categorical)
